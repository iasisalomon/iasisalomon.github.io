            <p class="mb-0">
              During my time at <strong>Sky Mavis</strong>, I reported directly to the VP of Operations and collaborated closely with departments such as finance, HR, security, publishing, and executive management. I create, implement and oversee processes that are understandable, replicable, scalable and easy to automate. My role involved optimizing workflows, improving cross-functional collaboration, and supporting strategic initiatives within the rapidly growing <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="A popular blockchain-based game featuring digital pets known as Axies."><em>Axie Infinity</em></span> ecosystem.

            <p class="mb-0">
              As a <strong>QA Automation Manager</strong>, I focused on writing test cases based on <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Test-Driven Development: A software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed."><em>TDD</em></span> and <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="Behavior-Driven Development: An agile software development process that encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants."><em>BDD</em></span> philosophies. I implemented these test cases with <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="A JavaScript test framework for Node.js programs, featuring browser support, asynchronous testing, test coverage reports, and use of any assertion library."><em>Mocha.js</em></span>, aggregated them in <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" title="A flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that provides a concise representation of test execution results."><em>Allure</em></span> reports, and coordinated with the team manager to ensure comprehensive deployment coverage. My role was essential in enhancing quality assurance efficiency and ensuring robust, reliable software delivery.
